# Python_Project_Accident_Informer
This is my self made projecct during my college time. I had created the project as a college project. The idea of project was taken from a south movie.Some helpful information was collected by me from google such as sensor in cars like impact sensor etc. The main idea is that we have a device which will be connected to impact sensor which will be giving output as 0,1,2,3 according to which we send the message to particular person, the device will be connected to message website(way2message etc.) this will aslo send the file of HTML which will tell the location of particlar person. This will help a lot to people when somebody accident will occure and nobody knows about it then this will be helpful to provide the location of accident and help particular person. I am sure that this will be improved in future and will be helpful a lot in future.
